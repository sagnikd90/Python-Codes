# Question 1) Which country won the most gold medals in the Summer Games?

# Question 2) Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?

# Question 4) Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.
